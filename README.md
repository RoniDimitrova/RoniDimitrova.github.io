This is a personal and non-profitable website I created for a university project with the sole purpose of practicing HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery. I DO NOT own any of the content nor am I related in any way to Paradox Interactive.
As a fan of Paradox Interactive, I decided to use their website for my project. I like their games, logo and company's philosophy so I decided to use their content and give a bit of "life" to the website instead of the usual Lorem Ipsum. Please, don't sue me lol!!!

All the content belongs to Paradox Interactive, you can visit the real website here: https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/

As for the images I've used, you can find more info, here:
